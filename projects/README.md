# Projects

This directory is for your development projects.
It is included in CI linting to keep code quality consistent.

Recommended structure:
- One project per subdirectory
- Add a project-level README and its own .gitignore if needed

Example:
```
projects/my-app/
  README.md
  .gitignore
  src/
```
